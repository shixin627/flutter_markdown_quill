*   [Polkadot 0.9.12 is out now](https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot/releases/tag/v0.9.12) - this is a medium priority upgrade due to some client bugs being resolved, a new transaction priority mechanism, and improvements in block production speed for some edge cases.
*   [Polkadot 0.9.12-1](https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot/releases/tag/v0.9.12-1) has been released. Note that this is a RUNTIME-ONLY release; node operators do not need to update their node software.
    

## üî¥ üèõ Governance

*   The **DotSama Experience team** has a [post](https://kusama.polkassembly.io/post/1051) looking for feedback on a potential Treasury Proposal for \"A Virtual Journey Through the Kusama & Polkadot Networks\".  
*   **Polkassembly** now has a section for [Council members](https://polkadot.polkassembly.io/council) to add information about themselves. This can help you make an informed choice when voting for Council members.
*   The first iteration of the Polkadot rebrand has been [released](https://vote.polkadot.network/) with two distinct directions available for the community to choose from. [Cast your vote](https://vote.polkadot.network/) and be a part of the historic Polkadot rebrand powered by on-chain governance and community participation.

> _total supply **- 11.5mil KSM**_ **||** _staking **- 43.6%**_ **||** _parachains **- 20.3%**_

*   [Kusama 0.9.12 is out now](https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot/releases/tag/v0.9.12) - this is a medium priority upgrade due to some client bugs being resolved, a new transaction priority mechanism, and improvements in block production speed for some edge cases.
    

## ü¶Ö üèõ Governance

*   There is a [proposal](https://kusama.polkassembly.io/proposal/51) to cancel one of the current crowdloans. Created by [Yung Beef](https://twitter.com/CryptoCowboyOG), the proposal seeks to cancel the Integritee crowdloan because the team ‚Äòmisled‚Äô the community by announcing a sale on KSM Starter (an IDO platform despised by the DotSama community). Read [the proposal](https://kusama.polkassembly.io/proposal/51) and add your thoughts to the conversation. Second the vote if you agree with the proposal.
*   **[Motion 385](https://kusama.polkassembly.io/motion/385)**, a request from Calamari to upgrade their chain to a new runtime, has been passed and executed. Note this is normally not necessary; see post for details. 
*   There is a [post](https://kusama.polkassembly.io/post/1056) on Polkassembly seeking feedback for lowering the deposit to open an HRMP channel. 
*   **[Referendum 145](https://kusama.polkassembly.io/referendum/145)**, proposing to add an additional 100 validators to the active set, is currently passing with three days left to vote.
*   **Polkassembly** now has a section for [Council members](https://polkadot.polkassembly.io/council) to add information about themselves. This can help you make an informed choice when voting for Council members.
*   **[Referendum 147](https://kusama.polkassembly.io/referendum/147)**, to upgrade Statemine to v504, is up for a vote.
*   **[Referendum 148](https://kusama.polkassembly.io/referendum/147)**, to upgrade Kusama to v9122, is up for a vote. This has been fast-tracked by the Technical Committee, thus voting will end after one day.

# ‚öô Core Stack

*   [Going forward, the \`--dev\` flag passed into Substrate nodes will imply \`--tmp\` if a \`--base-path\` is not explicitly provided](https://github.com/paritytech/substrate/pull/9938), meaning all dev chains are now temporary chains by default. To persist a dev chain‚Äôs database, pass in the base-path parameter.
*   [Block production speed has been improved](https://github.com/paritytech/substrate/pull/9789) for some edge cases where transactions to be processed are known to be invalid ahead of time.
*   üêú There was a bug where the wrong path was used for the parity-db database in Substrate nodes - the same one for RocksDB, meaning an overwrite would happen. [This has been fixed.](https://github.com/paritytech/substrate/pull/9971)
*   [Transaction priority has been reworked](https://github.com/paritytech/substrate/pull/9834) to favor smaller transactions, plus some other considerations.
*   üêú [There seems to be a bug](https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot/issues/4137) with multisig transactions in Polkadot‚Äôs latest runtimes. Developing‚Ä¶
    

# üåé Community & Ecosystem

*   [Metasafari's Dino x Dino released a new project on RMRK](https://url.rmrk.app/dino), opening up a dinosaur-egg pre-sale for certain RMRK Kanaria NFT holders. NFTs with utility taking over the Kusama ecosystem?
*   Interested in following XCM development? See this [tracking PR](https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot/issues/4118).   
*   Want to know about awesome projects on and about Substrate? Check [here](https://github.com/substrate-developer-hub/awesome-substrate).
*   The **Polkadot Hackathon, APAC Edition**, opening ceremony happened on Friday, 22 Oct. You can watch the replay [here](https://www.crowdcast.io/e/apac-hackathon/register).
*   **Jonas Gehrlein**, one of the researchers at Web3 Foundation, has written up [an analysis](https://polkadot.network/blog/kusama-batch-2-auctions-report/) of the second batch of six auctions on Kusama. 
*   There are benefits to installing [Polkadot{.js} extension](https://github.com/polkadot-js/extension) to your browser, even if you are not using it to store DOT or KSM. For instance, it blocks any scam sites it knows about automatically. If you find a scam site it doesn't know about, please add it to [the list](https://polkadot.js.org/phishing/) so it blocks the site for others.
    
# üõ† Tools


*   [The Polkadot JS Apps UI will now show a warning](https://github.com/polkadot-js/apps/pull/6393) if the recipient of a Treasury Tip has no balance and the tip is less than the existential deposit (meaning the funds would be burned). A bug affecting cancelation of multi-sig calls [has been resolved](https://github.com/polkadot-js/apps/issues/6369). The apps suite has been updated to [version 0.98](https://github.com/polkadot-js/apps/releases/tag/v0.98.1).
*   Ledger imports into the Polkadot JS Extension [will now also cater for the 25th word (passphrase)](https://github.com/polkadot-js/apps/pull/6380), which up until now was not possible.
*   [Substrate API Sidecar is at version 11](https://github.com/paritytech/substrate-api-sidecar/compare/v11.1.0..v11.0.0), adding an address validation endpoint.
*   [Polkadot JS API is at 6.5.2](https://github.com/polkadot-js/api/releases/tag/v6.5.2), adding fixes for historical \`at\` queries on top of 6.5.1
